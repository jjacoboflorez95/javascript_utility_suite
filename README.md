# 🖥️ JavaScript Assignment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project consists of three interactive JavaScript applications, each designed to perform a different task:

- **🔥 Convert Temps**: Converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- **🎓 Letter Grade**: Converts numeric grades into letter grades based on a predefined scale.
- **➕ Sum Numbers**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined number.

This project was developed as part of a college assignment.

## 🚀 Features
👉 **Temperature Converter**: Users enter a Fahrenheit value, and it is converted to Celsius.  
👉 **Grade Converter**: Users input a numeric grade (0-100) and receive the equivalent letter grade.  
👉 **Sum Calculator**: Users enter a number, and the app calculates the sum of all integers up to that number.  
👉 **📢 Interactive Alerts & Prompts**: Uses `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction.  
👉 **🎨 Simple & Clean UI**: Styled with CSS for a minimalistic design.
